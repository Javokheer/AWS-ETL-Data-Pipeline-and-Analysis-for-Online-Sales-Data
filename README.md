# AWS-ETL-Data-Pipeline-and-Analysis-for-Online-Sales-Data

## Overview
Excited to share my latest AWS project - an ETL data pipeline for analyzing online sales data! üéâ This project  demonstrates how to efficiently process and analyze sales data using various AWS services.

## Architecture
Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:
1. **Data Source**: CSV files stored in Amazon S3.
2. **Data Catalog**: AWS Glue Crawler scans the data and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
3. **ETL Processing**: AWS Glue Jobs perform the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
4. **Transformed Data Storage**: The transformed data is stored back in Amazon S3.
5. **Data Warehousing**: Data is then moved to Amazon Redshift for high-performance querying.
6. **Data Exploration**: Amazon Redshift Query Editor v2.0 is used for data exploration and analysis.
7. **Security**: All components are within a secure VPC to ensure data security.

## Features
- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Automatically ingest CSV files from S3.
- **Data Cataloging**: Use AWS Glue Crawler to catalog data.
- **ETL Processing**: Transform data using AWS Glue Jobs.
- **Data Storage**: Store transformed data in S3 and Redshift.
- **High-Performance Querying**: Utilize Amazon Redshift for efficient data querying.
- **Secure Environment**: All operations are performed within a secure VPC.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- IAM roles with necessary permissions for S3, Glue, and Redshift
- Amazon S3 bucket for storing raw and transformed data
- Amazon Redshift cluster

### Setup Instructions
1. **Upload CSV Files to S3**: Place your CSV files in the designated S3 bucket.
2. **Configure AWS Glue Crawler**: Set up a Glue Crawler to scan the S3 bucket and update the Glue Data Catalog.
3. **Create AWS Glue Jobs**: Define and run Glue Jobs to perform the ETL operations.
4. **Store Transformed Data**: Ensure the transformed data is stored back in S3.
5. **Load Data into Redshift**: Use Redshift COPY commands to load data from S3 into Redshift tables.
6. **Query Data**: Use Redshift Query Editor v2.0 to explore and analyze the data.

## Insights and Analysis
### 1. Average Revenue per Transaction for Each Product Category, by Region
**Why**: Helps identify valuable product categories in different regions, guiding inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
 SELECT 
    "region",
    "product category",
    ROUND(AVG("total revenue")) as avg_revenue_per_transaction
FROM 
    "dev"."public"."sales"
GROUP BY 
    "region", "product category"
ORDER BY 
    avg_revenue_per_transaction DESC;
```

### 2. Most Common Payment Method for High-Value Transactions, by Region
**Why**: Informs payment processing strategies, helps negotiate better rates with payment providers, and improves the checkout experience for valuable customers.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

### 3. Percentage Contribution of Each Product Category to Total Revenue, Month-over-Month
**Why**: Reveals shifts in product category performance over time, informing product development, marketing focus, and long-term business strategy.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

### 4. Average Basket Size and Total Value for Transactions, by Payment Method
**Why**: Understands customer purchasing behavior across different payment methods, informing strategies for upselling, cross-selling, and optimizing payment options.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

### 5. Average Time Between Purchases for Repeat Customers
**Why**: Helps develop targeted retention strategies, timing for follow-up marketing, and understanding product repurchase cycles.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

### 6. Top 5 Products by Revenue in Each Region and Their Market Share
**Why**: Identifies top-performing products in each region, helping focus marketing efforts, optimize inventory, and understand regional preferences.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

### 7. Impact of Promotions or Discounts on Total Revenue
**Why**: Evaluates the effectiveness of pricing strategies and promotions, informing decisions on discount levels and optimizing pricing for profitability.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

### 8. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Different Customer Segments
**Why**: Informs customer segmentation, targeting high-value customers, and allocating marketing budgets, guiding expansion strategies and resource allocation.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
-- Place your SQL query here
```

## Future Improvements
- Redirecting transformed data directly to Redshift to optimize the ETL process and reduce costs.
- Addressing unexpected charges on the free tier.

## Conclusion
This project has been a great learning experience, and I look forward to sharing more insights. Stay tuned for detailed SQL analyses and how these insights can drive business decisions in today's data-driven world.
